# paper_adventure

A small paper adventure for the course "introduction to programming". 
The game is set in the STAR WARS universe. 

After choosing your character (Jedi, Bounty Hunter, and Smuggler) you are able to navigate the dangerous planet "9-NR3W", a junk planet located on the edge of the galaxy. 
Retrieve a stolen valuable artifact for your faction or your own gain! 
But look out: your choices have consequences!

Throughout the game you are able to make decisions influencing the path of your story.

(The code is a little spaghetti)
